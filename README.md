A novel program for the search of global minimum structures of atomic clusters and molecules in the gas phase, using as a Coulomb interaction between Fukui functions-based method, is introduced in this work. The proposed strategy involves different steps. First, the calculation of the Fukui functions of the different fragments identifying them as electron- acceptor or donor species, according to their chemical potential value. Second, a population of individuals, created by the interaction between molecular fragments, is generated by the stochastic distribution of these fragments in size selected spatial box. Thirstily, the best structures are selected according to their Coulombic interaction between Fukui functions values.  Subsequently, the best candidates are relaxed to the nearest local minimum using a gradient method, i.e., ab-initio or DFT methods.
